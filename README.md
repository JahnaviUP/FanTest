## FanTest

This is a simple FanTest java code to implement change in speed and direction using two pull cords.

## Implementation

We have used a Fan class to implement the features of changing speed and direction and used the concept of data encapsulation to protectively access the speed and direction.
The max speed setting is set to 3 after which the fan will turn off (move to speed 0). The fan also remains in the same speed when the direction is changed and remains in the
same direction for any further speed changes.

An assumption is made, that the wall unit is always powered on.
